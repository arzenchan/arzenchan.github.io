<b>Old Folks at Home / Swanee River</b>
Stephen Foster 1851

C                 F      
Way down upon the Swanee River,
C         G
Far, far away
C                        F
That's where my heart is turning ever
C                G         C
That's where the old folks stay
                    F
All up and down the whole creation,
C       G
Sadly I roam
C                     F       
Still longing for the old plantation
C           G            C
And for the old folks at home

G                C               F            C    G
All the world is sad and dreary, everywhere I roam
C                 F
Oh, Lordy, how my heart grows weary,
C            G            C
far from the old folks at home 

C                     F
All 'round the little farm I wandered,
C          G
When I was young
C                      F
Then many happy days I squandered,
C        G       C
Many the songs I sung
C                  F
When I was playing with my brother,
C         G
Happy was I
C                 F
Oh, take me to my kind old mother,
C            G        C
There let me live and die

G                C               F            C    G
All the world is sad and dreary, everywhere I roam
C                 F
Oh, Lordy, how my heart grows weary,
C            G            C
far from the old folks at home 

C               F
One little hut among the bushes,
C          G
One that I love
C                        F
Still sadly to my mem'ry rushes,
C         G       C
No matter where I rove
C                    F
When shall I see the bees a humming,
C              G
All 'round the comb
C                     F
When shall I hear the banjo strumming,
C          G        C
Down by my good old home

G                C               F            C    G
All the world is sad and dreary, everywhere I roam
C                 F
Oh, Lordy, how my heart grows weary,
C            G            C
far from the old folks at home
