<b>Neaer My God to Thee</b>
Tranditional

G   D7  Em C             G         D
Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!
G    D7     Em C          G    D   D7  G
E’en though it be a cross that raiseth me,
G     C      G              G   C   G  D    G  D7
Still all my song shall be, nearer, my God, to Thee.
G   D7  Em C
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
G   D   D7 G
Nearer to Thee!

G   D7  Em C             G         D
Though like the wanderer, the sun gone down,
G    D7     Em C          G    D   D7  G
Darkness be over me, my rest a stone.
G     C      G              G   C   G  D    G  D7
Yet in my dreams I’d be nearer, my God to Thee.
G   D7  Em C
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
G   D   D7 G
Nearer to Thee!

G   D7  Em C             G         D
There let the way appear, steps unto Heav’n;
G    D7     Em C          G    D   D7  G
All that Thou sendest me, in mercy given;
G     C      G              G   C   G  D    G  D7
Angels to beckon me nearer, my God, to Thee.
G   D7  Em C
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
G   D   D7 G
Nearer to Thee!

G   D7  Em C             G         D
Then, with my waking thoughts bright with Thy praise,
G    D7     Em C          G    D   D7  G
Out of my stony griefs Bethel I’ll raise;
G     C      G              G   C   G  D    G  D7
So by my woes to be nearer, my God, to Thee.
G   D7  Em C
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
G   D   D7 G
Nearer to Thee!

G   D7  Em C             G         D
Or, if on joyful wing cleaving the sky,
G    D7     Em C          G    D   D7  G
Sun, moon, and stars forgot, upward I’ll fly,
G     C      G              G   C   G  D    G  D7
Still all my song shall be, nearer, my God, to Thee.
G   D7  Em C
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
G   D   D7 G
Nearer to Thee!

G   D7  Em C             G         D
There in my Father’s home, safe and at rest,
G    D7     Em C          G    D   D7  G
There in my Savior’s love, perfectly blest;
G     C      G              G   C   G  D    G  D7
Age after age to be, nearer my God to Thee.
G   D7  Em C
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
G   D   D7 G
Nearer to Thee!
