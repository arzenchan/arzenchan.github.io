<b>Engine 143</b>
Traditional - The Carter Family

(verse 1)
 A                        D             A
Along came the F15 the swiftest on the line 
                                   E
Running o’er the C and O road just twenty minutes behind 
 A                         D            A  
Running into Cevile head porters on the line 
                                       E            A
Receiving their strict orders from a station just behind 


(verse 2)
Georgie’s mother came to him with a bucket on her arm 
Saying my darling son be careful how you run 
For many a man has lost his life in trying to make lost time 
And if you run your engine right you’ll get there just on time 

(verse 3)
Up the road he darted against the rocks he crushed 
Upside down the engine turned and Georgie’s breast did smash 
His head was against the firebox door the flames are rolling high 
I’m glad I was born for an engineer to die on the C and O road 


(verse 4)
The doctor said to Georgie my darling boy be still 
Your life may yet be saved if it is God’s blessed will 
Oh no said George that will not do I want to die so free 
I want to die for the engine I love one hundred and forty three 


(verse 5)
The doctor said to Georgie your life cannot be saved 
Murdered upon a railroad and laid in a lonesome grave 
His face was covered up with blood his eyes they could not see 
And the very last words poor Georgie said was nearer my God to thee
