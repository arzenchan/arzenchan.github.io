<b>You Are My Sunshine</b>
Jimmie Davis 1939

C  G  D7  G

                               G7
The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
            C              G
I dreamed I held you in my arms
            C                    G
But when I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
              D7       G
And I hung my head and cried

G                            G7
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine 
            C                    G
You make me happy when skies are grey
             C                     G
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
                     D7        G
Please don't take my sunshine away

G  G7  C  G  C  G  D7  G

                                  G7
I'll always love you and make you happy
            C            G
If you will only say the same
           C                 G
But if you leave me to love another
                 D7       G
You'll regret it all some day

                             G7
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine 
            C                    G
You make me happy when skies are grey
             C                     G
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
                     D7        G
Please don't take my sunshine away

G  G7  C  G  C  G  D7  G

                                  G7
You told me once dear, you really loved me
           C                 G
And no one else could come between
               C                 G
But now you've left me and love another
                   D7     G
You have shattered all my dreams

G                            G7
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine 
            C                    G
You make me happy when skies are grey
             C                     G
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
                     D7        G
Please don't take my sunshine away
