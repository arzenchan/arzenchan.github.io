[Verse 1]

       D                     G        
If you ask any girl from the parish around
     A                         Asus2       D
What pleases her most from her head to her toes
       D                           G           
She'll say, I'm not sure that it's business of yours
      A                       D         
But I do like to waltz with a log driver


[Chorus 1]

A           D                G          
For he goes birling down and down white water
D                           A             
That's where the log driver learns to step lightly
     D                G          
It's birling down and down white water
  D                          A        D        D  A  D
A log driver's waltz pleases girls completely


[Verse 2]

         D                      G          
When the drive's nearly over, I like to go down
    A                          Asus2       D
And watch all the lads as they work on the river
  D                               G         
I know that come evening, they'll be in the town
       A                          D          
And we all like to waltz with the log driver 


[Chorus 2]

A           D                G          
For he goes birling down and down white water
D                           A             
That's where the log driver learns to step lightly
     D                G          
It's birling down and down white water
  D                          A        D        D  A  D
A log driver's waltz pleases girls completely


[Verse 3]

   D                            G          
To please both my parents, I've had to give way
    A                          Asus2         D
And dance with the doctors and merchants and lawyers
      D                          G         
Their manners are fine but their feet are of clay
            A                         D            
For there's none with the style of my log driver 


[Chorus 3]

A           D                G          
For he goes birling down and down white water
D                           A             
That's where the log driver learns to step lightly
     D                G          
It's birling down and down white water
  D                          A        D        D  A  D
A log driver's waltz pleases girls completely


[Verse 4]

    D                        G          
Now I've had my chances with all sorts of men
    A                     Asus2      D
But none as so fine as my lad on the river
   D                            G         
So when the drive's over, if he asks me again
  A                     D           
I think I will marry my log driver  


[Chorus 4]

A           D                G          
For he goes birling down and down white water
D                           A             
That's where the log driver learns to step lightly
     D                G          
It's birling down and down white water
  D                          A        D           
A log driver's waltz pleases girls completely
D                G          
Birling down and down white water
  D                          A         D       A  D
A log driver's waltz pleases girls com-pletely
