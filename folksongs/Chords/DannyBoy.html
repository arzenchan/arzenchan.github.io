<b>Danny Boy</b>
Traditional

[Verse 1]
         C Cmaj7     C7                   F        Fm         
Oh Danny boy,    the pipes, the pipes are calling
             C         Am               D7   G  
From glen to glen and down the mountain side
             C Cmaj7  C7            F     Fm
The summer's gone and all the roses falling
               C   Am      Dm     G      C
'Tis you, 'tis you    must go and I must bide

[Chorus]
G   Am   G/B  C         F               C
But come ye   back when summer's in the meadow
G  Am   G/B  Am      F          C          D7   G
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
            C C/E   F        D/F#   C  Em/B Am Am7/G Fm
And I'll be here in sunshine or in sha-     dow
         C       Am    Dm    G        C      G7/B
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy I love you so

[Verse 2]
          C Cmaj7  C7            F     Fm
But if he come and all the roses dying
         C G/B    Am     Am/G     D/F#    G
And I am dead, as dead I well may be
                C Cmaj7  C7               F     Fm
You'll come and find the place where I am lying
              C  Am    F   G         C
And kneel and say   an Ave there for me

[Chorus]
G  Am G/B   C            F               C
And I shall feel, though soft you tread above me
G   Am   G/B Am Am/G   F       C/E       D/F#   G 
And then my grave will richer, sweeter be
G   Am7 G/B  C    C/E F       D/F#     C   Em/B  Am  Am7/G  Ab7
For you will bend and tell me that you lo- ve    me
            C       Am      Dm      G       C   G7
And I shall rest in peace until you come to me
            C       Am7     Dm7     G11     C/G
And I shall rest in peace until you come to me
