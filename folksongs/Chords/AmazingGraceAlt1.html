[Verse 1]
     C              F/C        C
Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
                         G7
that saved a wretch like me.
     C      C7        F       C
I once was lost, but now am found,
     Am        G7     C   F/G
was blind, but now I see.

[Verse 2]
       C                    F        C
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
                      G7
and grace my fears relieved.
       C     C7        F       C                  
How precious did that grace appear, 
    Am      G7     C      A7
the hour I first believed.

[Verse 3]
D                        G        D
Through many dangers, toils and snares 
   D            A
I have already come
      D           D7        G         D                
Tis' grace hath brought me safe thus far
     Bm         A      D       G/A
And grace will lead me home

[Verse 4]
       D                    G       D
When we've been there ten thousand years,
          D            A7
bright shining as the sun,
      D       D7        G           D
We've no less days to sing God's praise
     Bm       A       D     B
than when we first begun.

[Verse 5]
E                   A          E
Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
                         B7
That saved a wretch like me.
     E      E7         A       E
I once was lost, but now am found,
    C#m        B7     C#m  A
Was blind, but now I see.
     F#        B      A/E E
Was blind, but now I see.
