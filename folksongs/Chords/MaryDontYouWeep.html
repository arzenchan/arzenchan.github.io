<b>Oh, Mary Don't You Weep</b>
Traditional Gospel - Bruce Springsteen

Oh Mary
C                  G7
Oh Mary, don't you weep, don't you mourn
                   C
Oh Mary, don't you weep, don't you mourn
F                  C
Pharoah's army got drowned
          G7        C
Oh, Mary, don't you weep

If I could I surely would
Stand on the rock that Moses stood
Pharoah's army got drowned
Oh Mary, don't you weep

Mary wore three links of chain
Every link was Jesus' name
Pharoah's army got drowned
Oh Mary, don't you weep

One of these nights about twelve o'clock
This old world's gonna reel and rock
Pharoah's army got drowned
Oh Mary, don't you weep

God told Moses what to do
To lead the Hebrew children through
Pharoah's army got drowned
Oh Mary, don't you weep

Moses stood on the Red Sea shore
Smotin' the water with a two-by-four
Pharoah's army got drowned
Oh Mary, don't you weep

God gave Noah the rainbow sign
No more water but fire next time
Pharoah's army got drowned
Oh Mary, don't you weep

Mary wore three links of chain
Every link was freedom's name
Pharoah's army got drowned
Oh Mary, don't you weep

The very moment I thought I was lost
The dungeon shook and the chains fell off
Pharoah's army got drowned
Oh Mary, don't you weep
