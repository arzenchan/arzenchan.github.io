<b>Motherless Child / Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child</b>
Traditional Spiritual

Am               Dm                Am
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
            Dm                     Am
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
            Dm                     Am
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
E    E7          Am   E7
Long way from my home

Am          Dm           Am
Sometimes I wish I could fly
            Dm        Am
Like a bird up in the sky
                Dm           Am
Oh, sometimes I wish I could fly
E      E7    Am  E7
Closer to my home

Am                  Dm          Am
Motherless children have a hard time
           Dm                          Am
Motherless children have-a such a hard time
                    Dm                      Am
Motherless children have such a really hard time
  E    E7       Am  E7
A long way from home

Am               Dm              Am
Sometimes I feel like freedom is near
            Dm                   Am
Sometimes I feel like freedom is here
                 Dm                 Am
Sometimes I feel like freedom is so near
          E  E7       Am   
But we're so far from home
