<b>Keep On The Sunny Side</b>
Carter Family

[Verse]

D         G              D
There's a dark and a troubled side of life
D                         A
There's a bright, there's a sunny side, too
A                     D
Tho' we meet with the darkness and strife
A                   D
The sunny side we also may view


[Chorus]

D                       G
Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side
D                      A
Keep on the sunny side of life
D                          G
It will help us every day, it will brighten all the way 
D                A              D
If we'll keep on the sunny side of life


[Verse]

D         G              D
The storm and its fury broke today
D                         A
Crushing hopes that we cherish so dear
A                     D
Clouds and storms will, in time, pass away
A                   D
The sun again will shine bright and clear


[Chorus]

D                       G
Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side
D                      A
Keep on the sunny side of life
D                          G
It will help us every day, it will brighten all the way 
D                A              D
If we'll keep on the sunny side of life


[Verse]

D         G              D
Let us greet with the song of hope each day
D                         A
Tho the moment be cloudy or fair
A                     D
Let us trust in our Saviour always
A                   D
Who keepeth everyone in His care


[Chorus]

D                       G
Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side
D                      A
Keep on the sunny side of life
D                          G
It will help us every day, it will brighten all the way 
D                A              D
If we'll keep on the sunny side of life
