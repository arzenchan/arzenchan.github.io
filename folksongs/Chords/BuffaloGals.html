<b>Buffalo Gals</b>
Traditional American

[Intro] (x2)
G D G D 

[Verse]
G
As I was walking down the street,
D                 G
Down the street, down the street,
G
A pretty little gal I chanced to meet,
D               G
Oh, she was so fair.

[Chorus]
C
Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight,
D                 G
Come out tonight, come out tonight.
G
Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight
D                             G
And dance by the light of the moon.

[Verse]
G
I stopped her and we had a talk,
D           G
Had a talk, had a talk,
G
Her feet took up the whole sidewalk
D                   G
And left no room for me.

[Chorus]

[Verse]
G
I asked her if she'd have a dance,
D             G
Have a dance, have a dance,
G
I thought that I might have a chance
D                    G
To shake a foot with her.

[Chorus]

[Verse]
G
I danced with a gal with a hole in her stockin',
D                             G
And her heel kept a-knockin', and her toes kept a-rockin'
G
I danced with a gal with a hole in her stockin'
D                                 G
And we danced by the light of the moon.

[Chorus]
C
Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight,
D                 G
Come out tonight, come out tonight.
G
Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight
D                             G
And dance by the light of the moon.
