Traditional - Carter Family

[Verses]
C                               G7          C
I will twine and will mingle my raven black hair
C                             G7        C
With the roses so red and the lilies so fair
C                             F       C
And the myrtle so green of an emerald hue
C                        G7       C
And the pale emanita and islip so blue

C                               G7          C
Oh he promised to love me, he promised to love
C                             G7   C
And cherish me always all others above
C                             F       C
I woke from my dream and my idol was clay
C                        G7        C
My passion for loving had vanished away

C                                G7           C
Oh he taught me to love him, he called me his flower
C                               G7          C
A blossom to cheer him through life's weary hour
C                       F       C
But now he has gone and left me alone
C                                G7            C
The wild flowers to weep and the wild birds to moan

C                               G7           C
I'll dance and I'll sing and my life will be gay
C                               G7        C
I'll banish this weeping, drive troubles away
C                          F              C
I'll live yet to see him regret this dark hour
C                              G7             C
When he won and neglected this frail wildwood flower.
