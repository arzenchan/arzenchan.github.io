[INTRO]

C F C G
C F C G C

[VERSE 1]

        C                F
Well my heart is sad and I'm in sorrow
C                  G
For the only one I love
     C                F
When shall I see him, oh, no never
       C           G       C
till I meet him in heaven above


[CHORUS]

   C                 F
Oh bury me under the weeping willow, yes
C                        G
Under the weeping willow tree
   C                 F
So he may know where I am sleeping
       C            G        C
And perhaps he will weep for me

[VERSE 2]
     C               F
They told me that he did not love me
   C                       G
I could not believe it was true
  C            F
Until an angel softly whispered
       C        G       C
He has proven untrue to you

[CHORUS]

[VERSE 3]
    C            F
Tomorrow was our wedding day
       C                   G
But oh Lord, Lord where is he?
     C                F
He's gone to seek him another bride
     G                C
And cares no more for me

[CHORUS]

[VERSE 4]
    C                 F
Oh, bury me under the violets blue
   C                G
To prove my love to him
     C                F 
Tell him that I would die to save him
        C      G           C
For his love I never could win
