<b>Molly Malone</b>
Traditional Irish

[Verse 1]
   C             Am
In Dublin's fair city,
          Dm           G
where the girls are so pretty,
  C            Em            Dm      G
I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone,
       C                 Am
As she wheeled her wheel-barrow,
        Dm                G
Through streets broad and narrow,
         C           Em        G            C
Crying, "Cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh!"

[Chorus]
  C            Am
"Alive, alive, oh,
 Dm           G
Alive, alive, oh",
        C           Em        G            C
Crying "Cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh".

[Verse 2]
    C         Am
She was a fishmonger,
    Dm            G
And sure 'twas no wonder,
    C           Em         Dm       G
For so were her father and mother before,
         C                  Am
And they each wheeled their barrow,
        Dm                G
Through streets broad and narrow,
         C           Em        G            C
Crying, "Cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh!"

[Chorus]
  C            Am
"Alive, alive, oh,
 Dm           G
Alive, alive, oh",
        C           Em        G            C
Crying "Cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh".

[Verse 3]
    C         Am
She died of a fever,
    Dm           G 
And no one could save her,
    C            Em           Dm      G
And that was the end of sweet Molly Malone.
        C                Am
Now her ghost wheels her barrow,
         Dm               G
Through streets broad and narrow,
         C           Em        G            C
Crying, "Cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh!"

[Chorus]
  C            Am
"Alive, alive, oh,
 Dm           G
Alive, alive, oh",
        C           Em        G            C
Crying "Cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh".
