<b>On Top of Old Smokey</b>
Traditional

[Verse 1]
C                F                       C      
 On top of old Smokey all covered with snow
                 G7                      C     
 I lost my true lover for courting too slow

[Verse 2]
                    F                        C     
 For courting's a pleasure and parting's a grief
                      G7                     C      
 And a false hearted lover is worse than a thief

[Verse 3]
                        F                         C     
 For a thief will just rob you and take all your pay
                      G7                           C      
 But a false hearted lover will lead you to your grave

[Verse 4]
                       F                       C     
 And the grave will decay you and turn you to dust
                   G7                            C     
 Not one boy in a hundred that a poor girl can trust

[Verse 5]
                     F                          C     
 The'll hug you and kiss you and tell you more lies
                             G7                             C      
 Than the crosswalks on the railroad and the stars in the sky

[Verse 6]
                    F                     C     
 So come you young maidens and listen to me
                     G7                          C
 Never place your affections on a green willow tree 

[Verse 7]
                      F                         C     
 For the leaves will wither and the roots will die
                   G7                           C     
 You'll all be forsaken and you'll never know why


[Outro]
                   G7                           C    F   C
 You'll all be forsaken and you'll never know why
