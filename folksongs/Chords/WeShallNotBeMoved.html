<b>We Shall Not Be Moved</b>
Spiritual

Mississippi John Hurt

I shall not, I shall not be moved
I shall not, I shall not be moved
Just like a tree that's planted by the water
I shall not be moved

I'm on my way to heaven, I shall not be moved
I'm on my way to heaven, I shall not be moved
Just like a tree that's planted by the water
I shall not be moved

Oh preacher, I shall not be moved
Oh preacher, I shall not be moved
Just like a tree that's planted by the water
I shall not be moved

I'm sanctified and holy, I shall not be moved
Sanctified and holy, I shall not be moved
Just like a tree that's planted by the water
I shall not be moved


Pete Seeger

We shall not, we shall not be moved, 
Just like a tree that's planted by the water
We shall not be moved

We're young and old together, 
we shall not be moved, 
Just like a tree that's planted by the water
We shall not be moved

We're women and men together, 
we shall not be moved, 
Just like a tree that's planted by the water
We shall not be moved

here's the city and country together, 
we shall not be moved, 
Just like a tree that's standing by the water
We shall not be moved

We're black and white together, 
we shall not be moved, 
Just like a tree that's standing by the water
We shall not be moved

yes, straight and gay together 
we shall not be moved, 
Just like a tree that's planted by the water
We shall not be moved

well, it's no nukes is good nukes 
we shall not be moved, 
Just like a tree that's planted by the water
We shall not be moved
