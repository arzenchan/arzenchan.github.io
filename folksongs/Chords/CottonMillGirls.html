Well, I worked in the cotton mill all of my life,
Ain’t got nothing but a barlow knife,
And it’s hard times, cotton mill girls,
Hard times everywhere…..

Chorus
And it’s hard times, cotton mill girls,
Hard times, cotton mill girls,
Hard times, cotton mill girls,
Hard times everywhere.

In 1915 we heard it said: 
“Go to Cotton Country and get ahead!”
But it’s hard times, cotton mill girls,
Hard times everywhere…..

Repeat Chorus

Now, Vilma de Bardo’s a long, long way,
Down Eli, Jake and Four D K,
But it’s hard times, cotton mill girls,
Hard times everywhere……

Repeat Chorus

We kids worked twelve hours a day,
For fourteen cents of measly pay,
And it’s hard times cotton mill girls,
Hard times everywhere…..

Repeat Chorus

When I die, don’t bury me at all,
Just hang my body from the spinning room wall,
And pickle my bones in alcohol,
And it’s hard times cotton mill girls…...

Repeat Chorus

Worked in the cotton mill all of my life, 
Ain’t got nothing but a barlow knife,
And it’s hard times, cotton mill girls,
Hard times everywhere…..
