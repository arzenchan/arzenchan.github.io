<b>Red River Valley</b>
Traditional

A

          A           E           A
From this valley they say you are going,
                                        E
we will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile
         A           A7         D
For they say you are taking the sunshine,
         A              E          A
that has brightened our path for a while

         A         E           A
Come and sit by my side if you love me,
                         E
do not hasten to bid me adieu
      A          A7        D
But remember the Red River Valley,
        A          E            A
and the cowboy who loved you so true

          A            E             A
Won't you think of the valley you're leaving,
                                E
oh, how lonely, how sad it will be?
    A            A7                D
Oh, think of the fond heart you're breaking,
        A             E          A
and the grief you are causing to me

         A         E           A
Come and sit by my side if you love me,
                         E
do not hasten to bid me adieu
      A          A7        D
But remember the Red River Valley,
        A          E            A
and the cowboy who loved you so true

       A          E           A
As you go to your home by the ocean,
                                 E
may you never forget those sweet hours
        A            A7        D
That we spent in the Red River Valley,
        A         E               A
and the love we exchanged mid the flowers

         A         E           A
Come and sit by my side if you love me,
                         E
do not hasten to bid me adieu
      A          A7        D
But remember the Red River Valley,
        A          E            A
and the cowboy who loved you so true
