Verse

Show me your motion...
Skip across the ocean...
Do the locomotion...

Folk-games of Jamaica (1922), Martha Warren Beck and Helen Heffron Roberts:
Dere's a brown gal in de ring...
Den yo wheel an' take yo' pardner,
Dere's a brown gal in de ring...
Den yo wheel an' take yo' pardner,
There's two girls in the ring...
Then skip across the ocean...
Then show you me your motion...
Then run and take a partner...
Then dance with your partner...
Then jig with your partner...
Fo she like sugar an' I like plum

Alternative from Louise Bennett-Coverley: 
She like sugar and I love plum
