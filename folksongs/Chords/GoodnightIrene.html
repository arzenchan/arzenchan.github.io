<b>Goodnight Irene</b>
Traditional/Lead Belly

[Verse]
C                     G7
Asked your mother for you
                             C
She told me that you was too young
                                  F
I wish, dear Lord, that I'd never seen your face
    C         G        C
I’m sorry you ever was born.

[Chorus]
C      G7
Irene, Goodnight
           C
Irene, Goodnight
                      F
Goodnight, Irene, Goodnight, Irene
     C       G     C
I’ll get you in my dreams.

[Verse]
C                       G7
Sometimes I live in the country,
                    C
Sometimes I live in town.
                          F
Sometimes I haves a great notion
        C        G         C
To jump into the river and drown.

[Chorus]

[Verse]
C                      G7
Stop ramblin' and stop gamblin’
                         C
Quit staying out late at night
                              F
Go home to your wife and your family
     C           G        C
Stay down by the fireside bright

[Chorus]

[Verse]
C                  G7
I loves Irene, God knows I do
                           C
Love her till the sea runs dry
                   F
If Irene turns her back on me
          C    G            C
I’m gonna take morphine and die
