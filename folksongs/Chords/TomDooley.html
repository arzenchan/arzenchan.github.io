<b>Tom Dooley</b>
Traditional Murder Ballad / Kingston Trio (1958)

     E
Hang down your head Tom Dooley,
                        B7
Hang down your head and cry,

Hang down your head Tom Dooley,
                       E
Poor boy, your bound to die,

E
I met her on the mountain,
                     B7
and there I took her life,

Met her on the mountain,
                    E
stabbed her with my knife,

E
Hang down your head Tom Dooley,
                       B7
Hang down your head and cry,

Hang down your head Tom Dooley,
                        E
Poor boy, your bound to die,

E
This time tomorrow,
                 B7
reckon' where I'd be,
               
Hadn't been for Grayson,
                  E
I'd been in Tennessee,


E
Hang down your head Tom Dooley,
                       B7
Hang down your head and cry,

Hang down your head Tom Dooley,
                        E
Poor boy, your bound to die,


E
This time tomorrow,
                  B7
reckon' where I'll be,

Down in some lonesome valley,
                        E
hangin' from a wide oak tree,


E
Hang down your head Tom Dooley,
                        B7
Hang down your head and cry,
   
Hang down your head Tom Dooley,
                        E
Poor boy, your bound to die,



E
Hang down your head Tom Dooley,
                       B7
Hang down your head and cry,

Hang down your head Tom Dooley,
                        D
Poor boy, your bound to die.
