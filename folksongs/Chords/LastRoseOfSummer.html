<b>The Last Rose of Summer</b>
Thomas Moore, John Andrew Stevenson

G             C       G
'Tis the last rose of summer, 
     Em       D7  G 
left blooming all alone
            C     G 
All her lovely companions 
          D   G
are faded and gone.
   Em            G 
No flower of her kindred, 
   Em          C
no rose bud is nigh
     G     C        G 
To reflect back her blushes 
    Em   D7       G 
and give sigh for sigh

I'll not leave thee, thou lone one!
To pine on the stem;
Since the lovely are sleeping,
Go, sleep thou with them.
Thus kindly I scatter,
Thy leaves o'er the bed,
Where thy mates of the garden
Lie scentless and dead.

So soon may I follow,
When friendships decay,
And from Love's shining circle
The gems drop away.
When true hearts lie withered,
And fond ones are flown,
Oh! who would inhabit
This bleak world alone?
