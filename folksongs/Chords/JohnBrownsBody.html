Traditional/James E. Greenleaf 1861

A traditional Union marching song, honoring abolitionist John Brown.
Lyrics written by William Weston Patton.

[Verse 1]
G
Old John Brown’s body lies moldering in the grave,
       C                               G
While weep the sons of bondage whom he ventured all to save;
                               B7                 Em
But tho he lost his life while struggling for the slave,
    Am      D        G
His soul is marching on.

[Chorus]
G
Glory, glory, hallelujah!
C                  G
Glory, glory, hallelujah!
                   B7 Em  Am         D        G
Glory, glory, hallelujah! his soul's marching on!

[Verse 2]
G
John Brown was a hero, undaunted, true and brave,
    C                              G
And Kansas knows his valor when he fought her rights to save;
                         B7              Em
Now, tho the grass grows green above his grave,
    Am      D        G
His soul is marching on.

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
G
He captured Harper’s Ferry, with his nineteen men so few,
    C                                  G
And frightened "Old Virginny" till she trembled thru and thru;
                                B7                  Em
They hung him for a traitor, themselves the traitor crew,
        Am      D        G
But his soul is marching on.

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
G
John Brown was John the Baptist of the Christ we are to see,
C                                   G
Christ who of the bondmen shall the Liberator be,
                                        B7                  Em
And soon throughout the Sunny South the slaves shall all be free,
        Am      D        G
For his soul is marching on.

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
G
The conflict that he heralded he looks from heaven to view,
C                                 G
On the army of the Union with its flag red, white and blue.
                                            B7                Em
And heaven shall ring with anthems o’er the deed they mean to do,
        Am      D        G
For his soul is marching on.

[Chorus]

[Verse 6]
G
Ye soldiers of Freedom, then strike, while strike ye may,
    C                             G
The death blow of oppression in a better time and way,
                                   B7              Em
For the dawn of old John Brown has brightened into day,
        Am      D        G
And his soul is marching on.

[Chorus]
