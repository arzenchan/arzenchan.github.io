[Verse 1]
        C                 
One evening as the sun went down
         F                 C
And the jungle fires were burning,
          C
Down the track came a hobo hiking,
        F                     C
And he said, "Boys, I'm not turning
      F           C           F    C
I'm headed for a land that's far away
  C                  G
Besides the crystal fountains
     C
So come with me, we'll go and see
     F               C
The Big Rock Candy Mountains

[Verse 2]
        C
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains,
           F                    C
There's a land that's fair and bright,
            F               C
Where the handouts grow on bushes
          F                G
And you sleep out every night.
            C
Where the boxcars all are empty
         F                C
And the sun shines every day
         F             C
And the birds and the bees
          F          C
And the cigarette trees
     F          C
The lemonade springs
            F        C
Where the bluebird sings
        G               C
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.

[Verse 3]
        C
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
         F                C
All the cops have wooden legs
         F                  C
And the bulldogs all have rubber teeth
          F                    G
And the hens lay soft-boiled eggs
      C
The farmers' trees are full of fruit
          F                C
And the barns are full of hay 
        F       C
Oh I'm bound to go
             F        C
Where there ain't no snow
            F         C
Where the rain don't fall
     F           C
The winds don't blow
        G               C
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.

[Verse 4]
        C      
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
      F                 C
You never change your socks
         F                  C
And the little streams of alcohol
         F                 G
Come trickling down the rocks
      C                        
The brakemen have to tip their hats 
          F                 C
And the railway bulls are blind
           F       C
There's a lake of stew
         F      C
And of whiskey too
         F          C
You can paddle all around it
      F    C
In a big canoe
        G               C
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains

[Verse 5]
        C
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains,
     F                 C
The jails are made of tin.
     F                  C
And you can walk right out again,
     F              G
As soon as you are in.
       C
There ain't no short-handled shovels,
    F               C
No axes, saws nor picks,
     F        C
I'm bound to stay
           F         C
Where you sleep all day,
            F        C
Where they hung the jerk
       F       C
That invented work
        G                C
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.

[Outro]
      F       C         F     C
I'll see you all this coming fall
        G               C
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
