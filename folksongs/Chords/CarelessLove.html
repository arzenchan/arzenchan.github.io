<b>Careless Love</b>
Traditional - Many Blues Artists

(lyrics as sung by Bessie Smith)

G        D                 G  
Love, oh love, oh careless love
G                          D
Love, oh love, oh careless love
G                 C
Love, oh love, oh careless love
G        D                 G
See what careless love has done 


G        D                 G  
Love, oh love, oh careless love
G                               D
You've fly through my head like wine
G                            C
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl
G       D                           G  
And you nearly spoiled this life of mine


G        D                 G  
Love, oh love, oh careless love
G                     D
In your clutches of desire
G                      C
You've made me break a many true vow
G        D              G  
Then you set my soul on fire


G        D                 G  
Love, oh love, oh careless love
G                  D
All my happiness bereft
G                           C
You've filled my heart with weary old blues
G       D                     G  
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself


G        D                 G  
Love, oh love, oh careless love
G                         D
Trusted you now, it's too late
G                       C
You've made me throw my old friend down
G          D                   G  
That's why I sing this song of hate


G        D                 G  
Love, oh love, oh careless love
G                         D
Night and day, I weep and moan
G                                   C
You brought the wrong man into this life of mine
G      D                         G  
For my sins, till judgment I'll atone
