<b>I Ride an Old Paint</b>
Traditional Western Cowboy

G
I ride an old paint, I lead an old dan 
      D                      G    
Goin' down to Montana for to throw the hoolihan 
     D                       G    
They feed in the gully, they water in the draw 
      D                           C             G    
Their tails are all matted, their backs are all raw


CHORUS:
      D     
Ride around little dogies 
      G
Ride around real slow 
        D                        C         G    
For the fiery and the snuffy are rarin' to go


G
Now old John Dunn had two daughters and a farm 
D                          G    
One went to Denver and the other went wrong 
    D                    G    
His wife was killed in a poolroom fight 
    D                  C          G    
But he sings this song most every night

CHORUS

G
And when I die take my saddle from the wall 
D                              G    
Put it on my pony and lead him out of the stall 
       D                     G    
Tie my bones to his back and point us out West
    D                      C           G    
And we'll ride the prairie we love the best

CHORUS x2
