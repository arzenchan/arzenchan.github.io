<b>Wayfaring Stranger</b>
Traditional - Johnny Cash

Capo at 3rd Fret

Verse
Am 
I am a poor wayfaring stranger,
                Dm                    Am
While traveling through this world of woe;
                         Am
Yet there's no sickness, toil or danger
               Dm         G      Am
in that bright world to which I go.

Chorus
Am        F               C
I'm going there to see my father,
          F         C          E7
I'm going there     no more to roam;
         Am
I'm only going over Jordan,

         Dm    Em   Am
I'm only going over home.


Verse
Am 
Though dark clouds will gather round me - 
                    Dm                        Am
I know my way is rough and steep - 
                          Am
Yet beauteous fields lie just before me,
                       Dm                     G        m
Where God's redeemed their vigils keep.

Chorus
Am            F                          C
I'm going there to see my mother,
                          F         C                     E7
She said she'd meet      me when I come;
                Am
I'm only going over Jordan,
                Dm     Em   Am
I'm only going over home.
