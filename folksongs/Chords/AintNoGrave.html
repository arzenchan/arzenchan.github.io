<b>Ain't No Grave</b>
Gospel - Claude Ely

               G         D            G
There ain't no grave can hold my body down
               C         D            G
There ain't no grave can hold my body down
 
When I hear that trumpet sound I'm gonna rise right out of the ground
Ain't no grave can hold my body down
Well, look way down the river, what do you think I see?
I see a band of angels and they're coming after me

Ain't no grave can hold my body down
There ain't no grave can hold my body down

Well, look down yonder Gabriel, put your feet on the land and see
But Gabriel don't you blow your trumpet 'til you hear it from me

There ain't no grave can hold my body down
Ain't no grave can hold my body down

Well, meet me Jesus, meet me. Meet me in the middle of the air
And if these wings don't fail me I will meet you anywhere

Ain't no grave can hold my body down
There ain't no grave can hold my body down

Well, meet me mother and father, meet me down the river road
And momma you know that I'll be there when I check in my load
Ain't no grave can hold my body down

There ain't no grave can hold my body down
There ain't no grave can hold my body down
