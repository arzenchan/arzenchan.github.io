<b>Boys From the County Mayo</b>
Traditional

[Verse 1]
      C           Am          F            Em
Far away from the land of the Shamrock and heather
   C           Am         D7        G7
In search of a living, as exiles we roam
         C       Am        F         Em
But when ever we chance to assemble together
   C            Am            G7
We think of the land where we once had a (D)home:
      C           Am          F            Em
But these homes are de stroyed and our soil confis cated
   C           Am         D7        G7
The hand of the tyrant brought plunder and woe;
      C           Am          F            Em
The fires are now quenched and our hearts desolated
      C           Am          G          C
In our once happy homes in the County Ma yo

[Verse 2]
      C           Am          F            Em
Long years have now passed since with hearts full of sorrow
   C           Am         D7        G7
The land of the Shamrock we left far behind;
      C           Am          F            Em
But how we would like to go back there tomorrow;
   C           Am         D7        G7
To the scenes of our youth, which we still bear in mind;
      C           Am          F            Em
The days of our childhood, it's now we recall them
   C           Am         D7        G7
They cling to our vision wherever we go;
      C           Am          F            Em
And the friends of our youth we will never for get them
      C           Am          G          C
They too are exiled from the County Mayo

[Verse 3]
      C           Am          F            Em
From historic Killala, from Swinford to Calla
   C           Am         D7        G7
Ballyhaunis and Westport and old Castle bar
      C           Am          F            Em
Kiltimagh and Claremorris, Belmullet and Erris
      C           Am          G          C
Kilkelly and Knock that is famed near and far;
      C           Am          F            Em
From Balla, Ballinrobe, Ballina and Bohola
   C           Am         D7        G7
Keeloges and Foxford a few miles below
      C           Am          F            Em
Newport and Cong with old Straide and Manulla
      C           Am          G          C
Charlestown too, in the County Mayo

[Verse 4]
      C           Am          F            Em
Then on with the cause 'till our aim is accomplished
   C           Am         D7        G7
Those who would fault us are cowardly and mean
      C           Am          F            Em
So stand in the fight 'till the tyrant is vanquished
      C           Am          G          C
Expelled from our dear little Island of Green
      C           Am          F            Em
With the foes of our land we have fought a long battle
   C           Am         D7        G7
Soon they will get their last death-dealing blow
      C           Am          F            Em
When old Nick has received them, their brains he will rattle
      C           Am          G          C
For the wrongs they have done to the County Mayo

[Verse 5]
      C           Am          F            Em
So boys pull together in all kinds of weather
   C           Am         D7        G7
Don't show the white feather wherever you go
      C           Am          F            Em
Act each like a brother and help one another
      C           Am          G          C
Like true hearted men from the County Mayo
