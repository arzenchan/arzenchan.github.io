Chorus
G
So long it's been good to know ya
D7
So long it's been good to know ya
G            C
So long it's been good to know ya
       G               D
What a long time since I've been home
         G        D         G
And I've gotta be drifting along

Verse 1
G                            Am       D
I've sung this song but I'll sing it again
       G                       Am          D
Of the people I've met and the places I've seen
   G                         C
Of some of the troubles that bothered my mind
      G                       D           G
And a lot of good people that I've left behind saying

Chorus
G
So long it's been good to know ya
D7
So long it's been good to know ya
G            C
So long it's been good to know ya
       G               D
What a long time since I've been home
         G        D         G
And I've gotta be drifting along

Verse 2
G                               Am            D
The sweethearts they sat in the dark and they sparked
     G                              Am        D
They hugged and they kissed in that dusty old dark
     G                              C
They sighed and they cried and they hugged and they kissed
      G                      D           G
But instead of marriage they talked like this honey

Chorus
G
So long it's been good to know ya
D7
So long it's been good to know ya
G            C
So long it's been good to know ya
       G               D
What a long time since I've been home
         G        D         G
And I've gotta be drifting along

Verse 3
G                       Am             D
I went to your family I asked them for you
     G                    Am              D
They all said take her oh take her please do
    G                         C
She can't cook or sew and she won't scrub your floor
     G                     D            G
So I put on my coat and tiptoed out the door singing

G
So long it's been good to know ya
D7
So long it's been good to know ya
G            C
So long it's been good to know ya
       G               D
What a long time since I've been home
         G        D         G
And I've gotta be drifting along

Verse 4
G                               Am      D
I walked down the street to the grocery store
       G                        Am            D
It was crowded with people both rich and both poor
  G                     C
I asked the man how his butter was sold
        G                       D             G
He said one pound of butter for two pounds of gold I said

Chorus
G

So long it's been good to know ya
G            C
So long it's been good to know ya
       G               D
What a long time since I've been home
         G        D         G
And I've gotta be drifting along

Verse 5
G                        Am             D
My telephone rang and it jumped off the wall
G                     Am       D
That was the preacher making a call
G                        C
He said we're waiting to tie the knot
G                        D           G
You're getting married believe it or not
G                                     Am            D
Well the church it was jammed and the church it was packed
    G                          Am           D
The pews were crowded from the front to the back
  G                          C
A thousand friends waited to kiss my new bride
    G                  D             G
But I was so anxious I rushed her outside told them

Chorus
G
So long it's been good to know ya
D7
So long it's been good to know ya
G            C
So long it's been good to know ya
       G               D
What a long time since I've been home
         G        D         G
And I've gotta be drifting along
